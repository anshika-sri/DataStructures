/******* * SIMPLE APPROACH AND SIMPLE CODE * 1. Logical approach[ Never go for complex things] * 2. Build your logic with dry run on pen paper * 3. Try bring an edge case at your build logic * 4. Work for more better approach in above ways[ where no edge case ] * 5. Your approach to fit has multiple options to use. Go for best option(simple usecase) like map (not array) * * 6. Start writing code .Note: Never run code before its complete by your side. * 7. TRy iterating intelligently through loops. * 8. Now work on code improvement.avoid duplication of variables and others. */
